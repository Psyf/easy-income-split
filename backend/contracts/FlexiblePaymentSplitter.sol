/**
 * @title FlexiblePaymentSplitter
 * @dev This contract allows to split Ether payments among a group of accounts. The sender does not need to be aware
 * that the Ether will be split in this way, since it is handled transparently by the contract.
 *
 * The split can be in equal parts or in any other arbitrary proportion. The way this is specified is by assigning each
 * account to a number of shares. Of all the Ether that this contract receives, each account will then be able to claim
 * an amount proportional to the percentage of total shares they were assigned.
 *
 * `FlexiblePaymentSplitter` follows a _pull payment_ model. This means that payments are not automatically forwarded to the
 * accounts but kept in this contract, and the actual transfer is triggered as a separate step by calling the {release}
 * function.
 *
 * NOTE: This contract assumes that ERC20 tokens will behave similarly to native tokens (Ether). Rebasing tokens, and
 * tokens that apply fees during transfers, are likely to not be supported as expected. If in doubt, we encourage you
 * to run tests before sending real value to this contract.

        When a Payee is added / deleted, we need to reset _released to ensure that the remaining people get their share of the balance
        Otherwise, their percentage of shares + whether they released earlier or not gets in the way of calcluations and makes it erroneous
        
        If you'd rather people get their share of the money even after they are kicked, we need a more complex system 
        where we keep track of received/released per token 

        This is possible in theory, just start a new "epoch" or released/received map everytime someone gets added/kicked. 

        However, this smart contract was made with the understanding that if someone gets kicked by the owner address, they forfeit whatever they have not released. 

        If you want to keep a historical record of payments in/out, you should look at the Events emitted - perhaps by using something like The Graph?

        Even though the "released" terminology is probably not the best, we keep it since it's based on PaymentSplitter

        Cost: The more tokens you use and the more payees you have, the more the opCost of adding/deleting/changing shares.
