## Must
- Need to write a proper readme / docs for users
- need to write tests for the solidity contracts / security 

## Nice to Have
- Form member added dynamically
- check whether selected smart contract (customer) is valid

## Bugs
- Toggling the same currentContract does not work 
- rejecting a tx sends the site crashing
- BlockEthPayment button always on -> even when blocked
